# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

Pewlett Hackard needed a better understanding of their workforce in regard to retiring employees vs employees eligible for mentorship programs. Using six CSV files containing data we were able to extract and create many tables that the company can use for analysis. Before that we had to create a visual interpretation of how our data links together. In the form of an ERD as follows:

## Results

Once we had an idea of how our data connects, we were able to create new data sheets and group employees in regard to their age, department, and tenure with the company. Some key points are;

  * A large portion of Pewlett Hackards workforce will soon be retiring.
  * Based on our conditions, a small percentage of PH employees aren't eligible for the mentorship program.
  * Onboarding new employees seems to be paramount to avoid a mass reduction of staff.
  
## Summary

Through our data we can see that PH may have to think outside the box to avoid a high turnover in their staff. By reducing the standards for the mentorship program or investing in hiring fairs PH can easily get in front of their future dilemma.
